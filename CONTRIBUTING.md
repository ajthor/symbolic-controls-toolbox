* Documentation
* Robustness
* Optimization
* New Functions!

## Issues
Issues should be submitted through GitHub's issue tracker, and the corresponding Matlab code should be included.

Steps to submitting an issue:

* Check your code thoroughly for errors before submitting an issue.

> code
> ```

Types of issues that will not be addressed:

1. Homework Problems(TM)
1. How do I do X/Y in control systems theory?
1. How do I do X/Y using the Symbolic Controls Toolbox?
1. Issues that are irreproducible from the code provided.
1. Issues that do not use the issue form above.
1. Why doesn't my specific system work?

**NOTE:** If a system that has a known response does not behave as expected using the functions provided in the Symbolic Controls Toolbox, this is an exception to the last item above.

Issues that violate the above criteria will be replied to with the following script:

> Thank you for your interest in the Symbolic Controls Toolbox. Your issue submission appears to be incomplete, irreproducible using the code provided, a general control systems question, or a Homework Problem(TM). Please refer to the Contribution Guidelines and provide additional information pertaining to your question. If you feel this message was posted in error, please provide additional information to clarify your issue.

Issues will be closed if no additional information can be given to clarify the issue.

## Code Contributions
To submit a code contribution, submit a pull request.

Code contributions should include:

* Proper documentation of changes.
* Well-formatted code.
* Unit tests for the change.

Code contributions can address any of the areas of interest. For code contributions that do not address one of the areas of interest, a suggestion should be submitted prior to submitting a pull request, giving the community time to gauge whether of not the feature is a good fit for the toolbox as a whole.

Pull requests should include a relevant issue in the description if they are in response to an issue.

All pull requests should target the *development* branch, **NOT** the *master* branch. Additionally, all new branches should originate from *development*.

### Style
