%% Elastic Region of Attraction Example
% An example of estimating the region of attraction of the Van der Pol
% equation in reverse time using an elastic search method.

%% Define the State Space Model
syms x1 x2
sys = symss;
sys.states = [x1 x2];
sys.f(1) = -x2;
sys.f(2) = x1 + (x1^2 - 1)*x2;

%% Region of Attraction (Lyapunov)
% The standard method for determining the region of attraction uses the
% Lyapunov method, and generally gives a conservative result. 
roa(sys, 'Trajectory', true);

%%
% We can see that the default Lyapunov boundary produces a poor estimation
% of the region of attraction. In order to produce a better approximation,
% we can use an elastic search method.

%% Elastic Region of Attraction
% Compute the elastic region of attraction using the standard method.
R = elroa(sys, 'Points', 30, 'Radial', false);

%%
% Convert the points to initial conditions.
ic = num2cell(R, 2);

%%
% Plot the trajectories using the initial conditions.
tspan = [0 10];

plot(R(:, 1), R(:, 2), 'o')

hold on
nlsim2(sys, tspan, ic)
hold off

xlim([-3 3])
ylim([-4 4])

%%
% We can see from the plot that the elastic method provides a less
% conservative region of attraction than the Lyapunov method. However, the
% points on the ring are drawn to the extrema of the region of attraction
% and can miss some non-convex boundaries.

%% Elastic Region of Attraction (Radial)
% Compute the elastic region of attraction using the radial method.
R = elroa(sys, 'Points', 30, 'Radial', true);
ic = num2cell(R, 2);

%%
% Plot the trajectories using the initial conditions.
plot(R(:, 1), R(:, 2), 'o')

hold on
nlsim2(sys, tspan, ic)
hold off

xlim([-3 3])
ylim([-4 4])

%%
% The radial method in general produces a more conservative result than the
% standard method. However, we can see that because the points are
% restricted to only moving radially outward, we can detect non-convex
% regions with greater accuracy than the standard method.
