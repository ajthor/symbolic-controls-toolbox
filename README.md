# Symbolic Controls Library

## What is this?
The Symbolic Controls Library is a free (as in speech), open-source library
written in C++ designed to implement a wide array of functions and classes for
working with control systems.

It is designed to address some of the limitations with the numerous control
systems toolboxes currently available and provide an interface for working with:

* Linear Systems
* Nonlinear Systems
* Hybrid Systems
* MDP
* etc.
